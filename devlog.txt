20220718 - Adding first Nb Search Algortihms
20220719 - Fixed OpenMP compilation. Now parallelizes OK.
           Fixed All Neighbor pairs and reduction arrays. Everything is working.
           Aded cubic kernel.
           Added thermal equation and example parallelized by particle.
20220721 - Working Thermal Solver.
20220802 - Begining to add mechanical things.
20220803 - Added reduction by pair in Thermal Solver. Still with errors.

20230222 - Working with elasticity.
           Added and allocated accel,  sigma 
           Interaction between particles corrected (it was dummy)
           Added strain rate and rotation rate calculations
           Added cylinder domain generator
20230223 - Elasticity. Added stress calculation.
20230224 - Added pressure to Stress Strain Calcs
         - Added corrected time calc functions
         - Added particle tag (id) 
20230227 - Fixed Stress Rate Calculation 
         - Working on fraser solver
20230228 - Fixed Rotation rate (added diagonal null values)
         - Fixed cantilever example boundary conditions
         - Fixed density increment calculation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
20230306 - Fixed error in acceleration not set to zero in every time step
         - Added nb, velocity and accel output
         - Found error in strain and rot rate increment, mj/rhojj was not calculated
         - Corrected critical error in density correction (it was updated rho directly in drhodt calculation)
         - Corrected critical error in BC application in solver before density calculation
